26. Question<br>For a customer's inventory application, several inventory specifications fields are needed on an inventory ticket. These tickets will be assigned to inventory support team members. How would you start to implement this requirement?<br><br><ul><li>Create inventory table as a new base Table. Then add inventory specifications fields, as needed</li><li>Create inventory table with the inventory specification fields. Then create view between the inventory and the Task table</li><li>Create inventory table with the inventory specification fields. Then create many to many relationships between the inventory and the Task table</li><li>Create inventory table as an extended table from the Task Table. Then add the inventory specification fields, as needed.</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> Create inventory table as an extended table from the Task Table. Then add the inventory specification fields, as needed.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Since the inventory tickets need to be assigned and managed like other tasks, extending the Task [task] table is the best practice. This allows the new inventory table to inherit all the task functionalities (like assignment, states, SLAs) automatically. You can then add the specific inventory fields to the new table.
