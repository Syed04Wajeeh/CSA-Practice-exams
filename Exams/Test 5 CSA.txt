It is a dynamic database that tracks CIs within your platform and, crucially, also tracks the relationships between them.
14. Question<br>You are importing data from an excel sheet into the Incident table. The Incident table already contains data. You want to make sure that the import doesn't result in duplicate records. What should you do?<br><br><ul><li>Uncheck the "Allow Duplicates" checkbox in the Transform Map form</li><li>In the Transform Map form, add a new record in the Compare related list to specify the comparison with Title column</li><li>Set the coalesce to Title field</li><li>Add a business rule to run after insertion. The business rule should delete the inserted record if it is a duplicate</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> Set the coalesce to Title field.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> When you set the coalesce option for a field in the Transform Map, you instruct the import process to check for existing records with that same value before creating a new one. If a matching record is found, the import updates the existing record instead of creating a duplicate.
15. Question<br>If a session requests access to data in a certain table, what happens if the user passes the table ACL rule but fails the field rule?<br><br><ul><li>The user will be granted access to the table but won't see the field which he doesn't have access to</li><li>None of the listed answers</li><li>The user is denied access to the entire table</li><li>The user is granted access to the entire table because the table ACL rule will override the field ACL rule</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> The user will be granted access to the table but won't see the field which he doesn't have access to.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> ServiceNow enforces a two-step ACL evaluation process. A user must first pass the table-level ACL to access the record. Then, for each field, the system checks the field-level ACLs. If a user fails a field ACL, they can still see the record (and other fields they have access to), but the specific restricted field will be hidden from their view.
16. Question<br>Which of the following features helps users see reasonable relationships between configuration items?<br><br><ul><li>CI Relationship Wizard</li><li>CMDB Relationship Assistant</li><li>CI Relationship Editor</li><li>CMDB Relationship Editor</li><li>CI Relationship Assistant</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> CI Relationship Editor.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The CI Relationship Editor allows you to view existing relationships between CIs and establish new ones.

When creating an incident, the system analyzes details like the category and description to automatically suggest knowledge articles that might solve the issue, which is a prime example of contextual search.
25. Question<br>Which of the following statements is correct regarding fulfiller and approver users?<br><br><ul><li>Fulfiller and approvers only have the approver_user role</li><li>Fulfiller users only have the itil role</li><li>Approver users have the itil and approver_user roles</li><li>Approver users only have the approver_user role</li><li>Fulfiller users have the itil and approver_user roles</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> Fulfiller users have the itil and approver_user roles.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Fulfiller users are typically those who work on and resolve requests (e.g., IT support staff). They need the `itil` role to access and manage requests. In many cases, fulfillers also need to approve certain requests, so they often have the `approver_user` role as well.
26. Question<br>Which of the following statements is most accurate when it comes to how the system evaluates ACLs when a session requests access a record?<br><br><ul><li>A user must pass both table and field ACL rules to access a record</li><li>A user must at least pass the table ACL rule to access the record</li><li>A user must pass either the table or the field ACL rules to access the record</li><li>A user must at least pass the field ACL rule to access the record</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> A user must at least pass the table ACL rule to access the record.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Table ACLs act as the first gate. When a user tries to access a record, the system first checks the table-level ACLs. If the user doesn't have the necessary permissions at the table level, they are denied access, regardless of any field-level ACLs.
27. Question<br>Which one of the following statements is correct regarding the difference between Save button and Update button?<br><br><ul><li>Save applies the input validations before saving the record while Update skips the input validations</li><li>Save allows the user to remain on the same record while Update returns the user to the previously viewed record</li><li>Update allows the user to remain on the same record while Save returns the user to the previously viewed record</li><li>Save is used to insert new records while Update is used to update existing records</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> Save is used to insert new records while Update is used to update existing records.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> "Update" is used when modifying an existing record; it saves the changes and typically returns you to the previous list. "Save" performs the same action on an existing record but keeps you on the form. A "Save" on a *new* record is effectively an "Insert". Some contexts use "Insert" or "Submit" for new records.
28. Question<br>What does the wildcard "*abc" mean?<br><br><ul><li>It will retrieve all results that contain "abc"</li><li>It will retrieve all results that are exactly "abc"</li><li>It will retrieve all results that start with "abc"</li><li>It will retrieve all results that end with "abc"</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> It will retrieve all results that end with "abc".<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The wildcard `*` represents zero or more characters. When placed before a string like `abc`, it means "any characters followed by abc". Therefore, `*abc` matches strings that end with "abc".
29. Question<br>If you need to display information in a form that is not a field in the record, what element should you add?<br><br><ul><li>Reference Field</li><li>Related Field</li><li>Formatter</li><li>Reference</li></ul>	<b>Correct Answer:</b> Formatter.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> A formatter is a form element used to display information that is not a field in the record. It provides an easy way to track items not saved with a field in the record, for example, to display comments, journal fields, or activity streams.
